## Shopify store

It is my first e-commercial project and I have made it in shopify

It is mobile responsible, lazy optymized

Functionalities:

- Configural header section (you can change logo)
- Configural footer section (blocks - navi/text)
- Presets (hero, featured collection, text/image section)
- Product page (slider, description, quantity, to cart, variants (there is a little problem with that)
- Collection (pagination, tag filters)
- Cart (simple table, removing products, very basic upsell)

I have been using shopify CLI, liquid, git, javascript, css

PS Don't judge me because of the html semantic, I was focused on liquid and functionalities
